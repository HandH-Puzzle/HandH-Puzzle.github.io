H&H puzzles is a showcase of the puzzles and puzzle hunts I've worked on. I create these for fun, so I don't have any regular publishing timetable. If you want to learn a little bit more about how to solve the puzzles, then check out the FAQs. 

### A bit about myself

I'm a mathematics graduate, currently trying to tackle my first job and all that entails. When I was young I used to love making mazes for my (somewhat unwilling) parents to solve. As I've grown older, I started to solve sudokus and other logic puzzles which lead me to puzzle hunts - something about the way each of the puzzles can be brought together to one meta puzzle has always intrigued me!
